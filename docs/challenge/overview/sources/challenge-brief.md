## Delphi Design Challenge

**Time:** 5-6 hours
**Presentation:** 45 min with team

### Context

Delphi lets people create digital versions of themselves. An AI version of you that talks, thinks, and responds the way you do. It handles repetitive conversations and FAQs on your behalf, so you only come in when the conversation gets interesting.

For this assignment, assume the user's primary goal is to become "share-ready" in one sitting and feel confident that their Delphi answers questions well.

### Current product:

LOOM WALKTHROUGH OF THE PROBLEM SPACE

Users go through a simple onboarding and land on their Delphi profile. The profile is a connected system:

- **Bio:** Who you are, what you're known for.
- **Topics (optional):** Areas of expertise highlighted in your bio. What people should talk to you about.
- **Questions:** Suggested questions users would likely get asked. These exist at two levels: profile level FAQs that apply broadly, and topic specific questions for each expertise area.
- **Answers:** How your Delphi responds. Generated by AI, shaped by training data and style settings.

These are connected. Topics are highlighted in the bio. Questions belong to topics or to the profile overall. Answers respond to specific questions.

### Current state:

Each element (bio, topics, questions, answers) are reviewable and editable. However, as a whole, the previewing/editing/training/steering UX is not a connected system:

- Bio, topics, and questions are somewhat connected to each other. Could be better, but functional.
- Questions, answers, and the system to preview, train, and steer are disconnected from each other.

### Before You Start

Use the product. Create a Delphi and try to improve how it answers a question. The pain points will become obvious.

## The Problem

When a user clicks on a question to see how their Delphi would answer it, they enter a fragmented experience:

Previewing the answer, editing it, training for better answers, and giving feedback are all disconnected flows. It's unclear what each action does or whether it worked. Users can't easily see: "here's how my Delphi answers this, here's how I can make it better, here's the result."

**Result:** Users complete setup but they can't form a mental model of how to improve their Delphi, so they leave before it's share ready. Those who do figure it out succeed, but it takes a lot of clicking around and trial and error.

The core issue is a broken improvement loop: users can't clearly see how their Delphi answers a question, take action to improve it, and verify that the change worked.

## Your Challenge

We want you to deliver two solutions

- For both solutions, anchor your work around a single moment in the product e.g., Profile → Questions list → click a question
- You may reference other parts of the product, but this is the primary entry point.

### Solution A: Constrained

You have 1-3 weeks of engineering time. What is the highest-leverage improvement you'd ship to help users understand and improve how their Delphi answers a question?

Focus on one key interaction that meaningfully improves the preview → improve → verify loop.

In addition to the design, briefly describe:
- What user behavior you expect to change if this ships
- One or two signals you'd look at to know if it worked

### Solution B: Unconstrained

Imagine no engineering timeline constraints. Design the ideal experience for a user to understand how their Delphi answers questions and improve it.

Showcase the ideal experience for a user to see how their Delphi profile look, answers questions and improve it. Demonstrate your vision of the full loop: preview, steer or train, verify.

## Deliverables

Pick ONE format to present both solutions. Respect the caps:

| Format | Maximum |
|--------|---------|
| Loom or video | 12 minutes |
| PDF with visuals or written doc | 6 pages |
| Slides | 12 slides |

For each solution, include:

1. What you focused on and why. What's the opportunity? Why start here?
2. The design. Show us the flow, not just a concept. We want to see: How does the user get here? What do they see? What actions can they take? What happens after? What are the key states?
3. How this improves the experience. What changes for the user? What's now possible that wasn't before?

**On fidelity:** Breadboards, wireframes, static frames, prototypes. Whatever communicates fastest. Don't match our design system. But show depth: user flows, key states, how pieces connect. A one page concept sketch won't cut it.

**For Solution A,** zoom in on one key moment. Pick the most critical interaction and show it in detail. What does the user see? What can they do? What feedback do they get? What are the edge cases? This is where we want to see your design craft.

**On the existing product:** Your solutions should work with the current product. If you're removing features, explain why they're not needed.

## We're Evaluating

| Dimension | What we're looking for |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Problem Identification | Did you find a real, acute pain point? |
| UX Depth | Is the thinking thorough? We want to see user flows, states, edge cases. Not just a concept sketch. Low fidelity is fine. Shallow thinking isn't. |
| System Thinking | Do you understand how the pieces connect? Solutions should work with the existing system. |
| Constrained Judgment | Can you scope to 1 to 2 weeks while still being meaningful? |
| Unconstrained Vision | How do you showcase your best ideas with limited time? |
| Communication | Is your thinking and communication clear and concise within the format caps? |

## Submission

Send your work to basten@delphi.ai within 3 days of receiving the assignment.

We'll schedule a 45 min presentation: approximately 25 min walkthrough, 20 min discussion.

We're not looking for one "right answer." We want to see how you identify opportunities, design systems, make tradeoffs, and communicate your thinking.

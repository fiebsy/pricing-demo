Hi, this is Mel, Head of Product at Delphi, and this is a quick video to showcase some of the surfaces and the product flows that are mentioned in the design assignment.

0:14
So this is our Delphi profile page. When a creator goes through an onboarding to have a Delphi, this is a page, this is the page we land them on, which is a already built Delphi, where they see their bio, suggested questions, sometimes topics that are highlighted with suggested questions that correspond to those.

0:41
If a user publishes this, this is exactly how it would appear for the visitor, right? Well, thank they could read the bio, click on a topic, see a question, get on a call, um, ask a question, an open-ended question, or click on one of these suggested questions.

1:00
So, let's say it is how does Delphi capture and preserve a person's force values and see how this Delphi, my Delphi, would answer this question if it was asked, and where we want to make sure, and this, as we are changing and this product is evolving, uhm, the loops of building this and steering this is where we want this assignment to focus on.

1:29
So if you kind of go back and think about, what informs this bio, but also what informs the answers to these questions, uh, there are a few elements.

1:45
One of them is the knowledge base. So there is, uh, creators add content to their mind, which come in various forms.

1:54
If we click on this plus button, it could be a file. They can do an interview about a specific topic, so they can transfer their knowledge. In a more bite-sized question-answer format, they can link a website, YouTube video, or a whole YouTube channel, and connect their Notion, Evernote, Google Drive.

2:13
So anywhere where there is video, audio, or written content that belongs to someone as their knowledge base, they can add the questions, and that informs the answer.

2:24
And what often happens is, if someone wants to edit, is they go on edit, they can rewrite, uh, the bio here, they can rewrite these questions.

2:37
So let's say I add a question, and I say, Why did you grow up? And then, I still don't know, again, if my Delphi can answer this, so I would need to save this. See that it shows up in my profile, I would click this.

2:55
Realize I don't have that detail in my notes.

3:07
Here I can revise this answer. And usually when it's a revision. Creators don't always know whether that actually added anything to their knowledge base.

3:19
Or, I can go back, click this plus button. Say, I actually want to add a question answer pair. And, where did you grow up? In Los Angeles. Add to mind. and that triggers a, a training loop.

3:41
So, this is where my mind is working. So, once this is completed. Wait. Be quick. I won't wait for it, but once the learning is completed, if I were to click on this question, the answer of my Delphi would change and it would say, hey, I grew up in Los Angeles.

4:00
And I'll And let's do another one, the, on the rubric of how to evaluate PMs. Um, usually what the, for an answer, what a, um, creator wants to change is they might want to change a question and on the answer, it's either the substance, the answer is wrong or incomplete, or it could be style, which is not liking how their Delphi sounds, how it speaks.

4:22
So for instance, I might think, I actually don't want bulleted answers. And there are a few ways of going about it, the adjusting the speaking style.

4:38
And when creators go about it this way, they still are not sure. They don't know what speaking style means. Also, they also don't really know if this is a universal change, if this is something that Delphi will understand and keep doing or not. Or if it's specific to this one question.

4:49
Um, and then one area that where a lot of this could be controlled, where we do not want the creators to go to this tab, but often they end up here and editing a lot of it is in the mind settings where they could actually set a purpose, which is like a prompt for their Delphi, custom instructions, like never use bullets.

5:09
Um, keep it short and concise. Uh, they can outline when their Delphi does not have an answer. How, how do you want the Delphi to communicate that? The response length, the creativity, which is how strict on the creativity, speaking style.

5:33
And again, this is a very long list, but this is when, it. Building a Delphi gets a lot more technical, and what we want for this assignment is to think through, given all these elements, there's a bio topics, questions, answers to these questions.

5:49
What would be a loop, a training loop, training and steering loop that would be a complete experience where a creator with very little context, who has not watched this video and given that they. They don't know how any of this works, can come in, see the value immediately, see an answer, edit that for all the various ways, and then get a feedback loop where they understand, or get a confirmation where they understand what just happened.

6:18
How do we both make this possible and encourage this loop is the scope of this assignment and good luck.
